## InstaCarro Auction Page
I was asked to develop this auction module using ReactJS. 
I used create-react-app to kickstart, it is vanilla JavaScript.

In order to run the project, do the following steps:
- clone or download the project.
- If not installed, install Node.js.
- In the console, navigate to the project folder.
- Execute "npm install" to install all project dependencies.
- Execute "npm start" to run the app.

### Technologies:
- Flexbox: for responsive purpose.
- Media queries : to adapt the view on mobile.
- concurrently: to boot multiple servers.
- bodyParser : A Node.js body parsing middlewarefetch.
- fetch: allows you to make network requests similar.
